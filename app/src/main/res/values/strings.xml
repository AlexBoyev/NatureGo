    <string name="gecko_information">Geckos are small to medium-sized lizards. They are found all over the world in warm climates.
There are over 1,100 different species of geckos. Several species, such as the House Gecko, will enter houses and climb over the walls and ceilings eating insects. Many people also keep geckos as pets in aquariums. The most common pet gecko is the Leopard Gecko.
Geckos range in size from 3/4 to 14 inches long.
The life span of a gecko can be as long as 30 years.
Most geckos are nocturnal.
The largest gecko is the Tokay Gecko and the smallest is the Dwarf Gecko.
Geckos come in a wide variety of colors, patterns and textures. Some geckos can change color like chameleons.
Geckos are different from other lizards, because they use vocal chirps to communicate with each other.
Although some geckos have claws, most have thousands of hair-like structures on their feet which allows them to stick to and climb slippery and flat surfaces. Most species of gecko have a clear membrane to protect the eyes instead of eyelids. They also lick this membrane to keep it clean.
If a gecko accidentally loses its tail it has the ability to grow a new one.

    <string name="hoopoe_information">Hoopoe is a medium-sized bird that can reach length between 9.8 to 12.6 inches and weight between 1.6 and 3.1 ounces. It has a wingspan of 17.3 to 19 inches.
Hoopoe is named after onomatopoeic sound produced by the bird: oop-oop-oop.
he is easily recognized because of its colorful feathers. Bird is cinnamon to chestnut in color, with white and black stripes on the wings and tail. It has prominent, upright crest on its head.
Hoopoe has long and strong black beak. It is curved and adapted for the feeding on the ground,
eats different type of insects, small reptiles, snails, frogs, seeds, berries and other types of plant materials.
Hoopoe has very muscular bill which can be opened while stuck in the ground when the bird is looking for food.
Hoopoe enjoys bathing on the sun and in the dust. During sunbathing, takes specific position: it tilts its head back and spread its wings and tail above the ground.
Subspecies of hoopoe that live in temperate climate belong to group of migratory species. They have large and muscular wings, which are required for the prolonged flights.
Hoopoe is characterized by undulating flight. Movement of its wings resembles the movement of the wings of a butterfly.
Hoopoe is a territorial animal. Territory is usually populated with a single mating couple. Male will readily fight with intruders to defend its territory.

    <string name="frog_information">Frog is the common name for amphibians in the order Anura.
Adult frogs are characterised by long hind legs, a short body, webbed digits, protruding eyes and the absence of a tail.
Most frogs have a semi-aquatic lifestyle, but move easily on land by jumping or climbing.
They typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds or lakes, and their larvae, called tadpoles, have gills and develop in water.
Adult frogs follow a carnivorous diet, mostly of arthropods, annelids and gastropods.
Frogs are most noticeable through their call, which can be widely heard during the mating season.
The distribution of frogs ranges from tropic to subarctic regions, with most of the species found in tropical rainforests.
With over 5,000 species described, they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates.
However the declining numbers of certain species of frogs are increasingly giving cause for concern.

    <string name="ciconia_information">The white stork has a strong body which measures 100 – 115 centimetres (39 – 45 inches) from beak tip to tail end and weighs 2.5 – 4.4 kilograms.
        It has a wingspan of 195 – 215 centimetres (77 – 85 inches).
The white stork is a distinctive large wading bird which has a white plumage with black flight feathers and wing coverts.
        The black colouration is caused by the pigment melanin and carotenoids in their diet.
Adult white storks have long pointed red beaks, long red legs with partially webbed feet on the end and a long, slender neck.
        They have black skin around their eyes and their claws are blunt and nail-like. Males and females are identical in appearance,
        however, males are slightly larger in size. The feathers on the chest are long and form a ruff which is sometimes used when performing courtship displays.

    <string name="otter_information">The charismatic otter, a member of the weasel family, is found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica.
        Most are small, with short ears and noses, elongated bodies, long tails, and soft, dense fur. Webbed feet and powerful tails,
        which act like rudders, make otters strong swimmers. Their nostrils and ears close to keep water out,
        and waterproof fur keeps them warm All otters are expert hunters that eat fish, crustaceans, and other critters.
        Sea otters have an ingenious method to open shellfish. A sea otter will float on its back, place a rock on its chest,
        then smash the mollusk down on it until it breaks open. When it’s time to nap, sea otters entangle themselves in kelp so they don’t float away.
        They also sometimes intertwine their feet with another sea otter, so that they stay together.

    <string name="mongoose_information">Mongooses are long, furry creatures with a pointed face and a bushy tail. Despite popular belief, mongooses are not rodents.
        They are members of the Herpestidae family, which also includes civets and meerkats. There are 34 species of mongoose in 20 genera, according to the University of Michigan\s Animal Diversity Web (ADW).
        With so many different types of mongoose, sizes vary greatly. Their bodies range from the dwarf mongoose at 7 inches (18 centimeters) long to the Egyptian mongoose,
        which is 2 feet (60 cm) long, Most species of mongoose are found in Africa, but some also live in southern Asia and the Iberian Peninsula, Banded mongoose colonies live, travel and fight together as a team.
        They stay in one area for around a week, then move in a wave to another location, much like a flock of birds when they migrate

    <string name="stellagama_information">The stellagama is a member of the Herdon family in the series of lizards. It is common in Asia, Africa and Australia.
        This is the most common mustard of all the stellagama in the country.
The stellagama\'s head is wide and covered with small scales. The body is bulky and strong. The tail is tight and barely detached from the rest of the body.
        When the tail was cut off, a new tail grew in its place. The tongue is thick, fluffy, sticky and relatively short.
His bite hurts because his fangs are strong. There are two longitudinal lines of warty scales that appear to be a zipper and its identification mark.
        Its color ranges from gray-black to yellow-gray.
The color change of the stellagama found has a role in absorbing heat. In the morning, the mustard is dark and in the evening it becomes clearer and less heat is absorbed into the body.
The stellio is found in holes and burrows in the soil, rock crevices and walls.
The area of his life is protected by high vantage points, on which he stands and surveys the area. He has several estates,
        each of which can be found from one female to four females and several offspring.
It can be seen in the daytime running around walls, walls, rocks and trees.

During the cold days of winter, the activity of the mustard decreases, and is in a kind of hibernatioThe stellio is heated by exposure to the sun\'s rays.n.
The Haredim are territorial and live in families called testimony. The adult mustard does not change the color of its body to stand out in the field, and so inform all the individuals in the surrounding area.
He takes possession of himself and threatens other males by various means: terrible cows, tail flaps, bumps and bites

    <string name="fruitBat_information">The fruit bat, also known as the “flying fox,” is one of the largest bats in the world, receiving its name from its fox-like face and large eyes.
        Unlike most bats, this flying mammal uses its sight rather than echolocation to locate food. Hearing the loud squeals of other bats feeding also helps it
        locate a food source. Flying foxes have two claws on the leading edge of their wings and pointed teeth. If we look at the jaws of the fruit bat,
        it has very sharp teeth. Most people have been taught that this is a design for a carnivorous animal. However, this unique creature is 100 percent
        vegetarian. Their entire diet consists of blossoms and fruit. When feeding on fruit, they drink the juice and spit out the pulp.
        Flying foxes have trouble getting into the air if caught on the ground, so they feed on fruit in the trees and will not follow a meal if it drops to the ground.
        They get their water by skimming over rivers and lakes and thus avoid having to land.

    <string name="honeyBadger_information">Honey badgers, also known as ratels, are related to skunks, otters, ferrets, and other badgers.
        These voracious omnivores get their name from their fondness for feeding on honey and honeybee larvae.
        They also eat insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, as well as roots, bulbs, berries, and fruits.
        Though they hunt for their own food most of the time, they’ll happily steal from other carnivores or scavenge the kills of bigger animals when the opportunity arises.
        Their prominent, sharp teeth, long foreclaws, and stocky build allow them to easily rip meat from bone.
        Honey badgers can be found throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and western Asia.
        They can adapt to a variety of conditions, from warm rain forests to cool mountains
Good at turning rock crevices and hollowed trees into shelters, honey badgers will also make homes in the abandoned dens of other animals like yellow mongooses.

    <string name="cat_information">Felis catus has had a very long relationship with humans. Ancient Egyptians may have first domesticated cats as early as 4,000 years ago. Plentiful rodents probably drew wild felines to human communities. The cats skill in killing
Like their wild relatives, domestic cats are natural hunters able to stalk prey and pounce with sharp claws and teeth.
        They are particularly effective at night, when their light-reflecting eyes allow them to see better than much of their prey. Cats also enjoy acute hearing. All cats are nimble and agile,
        and their long tails aid their outstanding balance.Domestic cats remain largely carnivorous, and have evolved a simple gut appropriate for raw meat. They also retain the rough tongue that can help them clean every last morsel from an animal bone (and groom themselves).
        Their diets vary with the whims of humans, however, and can be supplemented by the cats own hunting successes.

    <string name="lion_information">Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, the lion is the second largest cat in the world.
        It is dwarfed slightly by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar body type.Unlike other cats, lions are very social animals. They live in groups,
        called prides, of around 30 lions. A pride consists of up to three males, a dozen related females, and their young. The size of the pride is determined by the availability of food and water. If resources are scarce,
        the pride becomes smaller.Males and females take on very different roles in the pride. Male lions spend their time guarding their territory and their cubs. They maintain the boundaries of their territory,
        which can be as large as 260 sq. km (100 sq. mi.), by roaring, marking it with urine, and chasing off intruders. Their thick manes, a unique trait to male lions, protect their necks when they fight with challengers

    <string name="penguin_information">Penguins are torpedo-shaped, flightless birds that live in the southern regions of the Earth. Though many people imagine a small, black-and-white animal when they think of penguins,
        these birds actually come in a variety of sizes, and some are very colorful.
For example, crested penguins sport a crown of yellow feathers. Blushes of orange and yellow mark the necks of emperor and king penguins. What look like bright yellow, bushy eyebrows adorn the heads of some species,
        such as the Fiordland, royal, Snares and rockhopper penguins. The macaroni penguin\'s name comes from the crest of yellow feathers on its head, which looks like the 18th-century hats of the same name.
        A light yellow mask covers the face of the yellow-eyed penguin around the eyes.
